	<h2> Tiddley Cove history</h2>
	
	<p>Tiddley Cove was founded in 1986 as the Captains Ladies, changing its name to Tiddley Cove in 1988. Since then, we have danced traditional and a few original Morris dances. Our dances currently include border, Betty Lupton and Adderbury as well as current choreography. While originally an all-woman’s side, we were once well known for our red and white petty coats; we now wear more traditional colourful sashes or baldricks. We are closely associated with all men’s side The Vancouver Morris Men and can be seen at some of the same events together such as May Day Morning.

	<h2>About Morris Dancing</h2>
	
	<p> Morris is a traditional British dance whose roots go back to the early 1400’s. Teams of 2 to 10 people dancing in sets. We are known for theuse of distinctive props including sticks that are clashed together, handkerchiefs used for flourishing, and bells worn on the feet or legs. Morris dance teams each have their own uniform or kit; from straw hats bedecked with flowers, baldrics, black top hats or rag coats. Morris dancers typically celebrate seasonal activities and attend festivals or ales. There are many styles of Morris dance associated with diﬀerent villages and regions of England but are performed around the commonwealth and Americas, with sides performing in Australia,Canada, and the United States.
